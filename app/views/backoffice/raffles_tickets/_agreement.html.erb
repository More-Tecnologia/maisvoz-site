      THE RAFFLE<br/>

      Federal Lotteries. The RIFA will be available for drawing whenever 100% of its quotas are sold.
      The system automatically closes the RIFA and sends an email to each participant with the date and
      time of the draw.<br/>
      QUINA carries out the draws for extractions, six days a week, from Monday to Saturday, with the
      exception of Sundays. If there is an important holiday on the date of the draw, the draw is held on
      the following day, with the exception of Sundays, if the holiday falls on a Saturday, the draw is held
      on the following Monday.<br/>
      The draws can be followed through the website: https://loterias.caixa.gov.br/Paginas/Quina.aspx<br/>

      example the number drawn was 78.RIFAS with 1,000 shares
      Looking from left to right, the second digit of the first three tens generates the hundred 783, so in
      this example the number drawn was 783.
      Using 10,000 shares
      Looking from left to right, the second digit of the first four tens generates the thousand 7,834, so in
